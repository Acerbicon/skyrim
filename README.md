### About

This repository holds the BOSSv3 masterlist for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. For more information on the format and syntax of the masterlist, please see the Metadata Syntax documentation in the [boss-code](https://github.com/boss-developers/boss-code) repository.

SilentSpike has created a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgxujbKszmPOdHcwNnRXTGZmcjVUSXkxQUV4MUlINnc&usp=sharing) for gathering data on which users are the most reliable sources of data. In his own words:

> After a recent discussion on the forums which concerned users supplying us with information on mods, I figured it might be a good idea to confirm which users are reliable sources of information.

> The idea behind this post is that I can make a spreadsheet of Bethsoft forum names and continue to add to it over time - allowing us to get an idea of which users reports can most likely be added to the list based on their information rather than having to check it ourselves. Of course, a fair system should be in place. So rather than simply adding users based on our perceptions, I'll have a username and the number of reports by that user that have been confirmed to be correct beside it (as well as the number which have been added from that user without confirmation).

> If anyone else confirms or trusts a report from a user feel free to go ahead and add that info yourself. Just to make clear, a confirmed report is where the committer has checked the mod themselves and it matches the info given, a trusted report is where the committer has added info based on the users report alone.

> (Note that this is only for reports that provide info about a mod - such as dirty edits or dependencies)

This repository is currently a work in progress.
